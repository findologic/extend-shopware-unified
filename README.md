## Requirements

* In the left side menu, click on "Installed"
* Upload the packaged plugin using the "Upload plugin" button
* The plugin should be listed in the section for uninstalled plugins
* Click on the green circle to install it
* Confirm when you are asked to clear caches
* Enter your shopkey in the plugin's configuration tab

## Update safety
It is neccessary to mention that update safety means that the changes done to the search and export won't be lost due to
an update of the main plugin. Checking the search and the export functionallity afterwards is recommended!
